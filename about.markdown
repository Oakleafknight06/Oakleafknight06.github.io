# About the Website
This blog/website is simply my little corner of the internet, where I can put projects I'm working on or information I've compiled which might be useful to others. It will mostly be tech / cybersecurity stuff, but may include other topics such as music if I feel like it. It's inspired by [tomontheinternet](https://tomontheinternet.com) and other similar personal blogs. If you see anything that needs fixing, or just want to interact, feel free to open an issue or pull request!

# About Me
I'm a student studying cybersecurity, and someone who enjoys tech generally. I will add portfolio-type content here by and by, but for now just take a look at [my github](https://github.com/oakleafknight06). Right now, the main thing I'm working on is my personal operating system image, built and hosted with Github, based on [secureblue](https://secureblue.dev).
