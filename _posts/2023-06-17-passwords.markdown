### Secure Passwords

What makes password secure
maths
Number of guesses to take
entropy
but, assumes *brute force attack*
Ways to crack password with smarter
Why non-random is bad (leads from previous, plus publicly knowable info)
DONT USE DUPLICATES

### Password Managers

	- Online passsword managers

		[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)

		A FOSS password manager. Can be self-hosted if desired. Free and premium tiers.

		[1Password](https://1password.com) 

		Not FOSS, but has regular audits and works closely with password cracking community. In this respect it is better than Bitwarden. Starts at $4 a month, no free tier.

	- [KeePass](https://keepass.info) (FOSS, A file format, compatible with many clients)

		[KeePass XC](https://keepassxc.org/) Windows/macOS/Linux (free)

		[KeePass DX](https://www.keepassdx.com/) Android (free)

		[KeePassium iOS](https://keepassium.com/) (paid)


[Don't](https://palant.info/2022/12/26/whats-in-a-pr-statement-lastpass-breach-explained/) use [LastPass](https://infosec.exchange/@epixoip/109585049354200263).

Evaluate password managers based on their handling of sensitive data, transparency with regular third-party audits, cryptography, and competency in response to security incidents when they happen.

Some information, and pros/cons of using them (and why it is worth it to do so).
